"PRIMEVAL my love for the woman I love,O bride! O wife! more resistless, more enduring than I can tell, the thought of you!Then separate, as disembodied, the purest born,The ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation,I ascend\u2014I float in the regions of your love, O man,O sharer of my roving life."
